Hi.&nbsp;👋🏻 &nbsp;**Well come.**&nbsp;

Welcome to the C++ course offered by [Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy](https://www.udemy.com/user/learn-programming-academy/). This repository contains the materials and resources needed for the course. Here, you will find lessons, exercises, and practical projects to help you learn and apply the fundamental concepts of modern C++. I'll also share with you my difficulties and what I figure out during the course.
